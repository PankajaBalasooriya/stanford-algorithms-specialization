# Algorithms Specialization

This repository contains my solutions for the [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) offered by Stanford University on Coursera. The specialization is taught by Professor Tim Roughgarden and covers essential topics in algorithm design and analysis.

## Specialization Overview

The specialization consists of four courses:

1. **Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms**
2. **Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**
3. **Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**
4. **Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them**

Each course includes weekly lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments that reinforce the concepts learned.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Course1_Divide_and_Conquer/`: Contains materials for the first course.
  - `Week1/`: Materials for Week 1.
    - `lecture_notes.md`: Personal notes from the lectures.
    - `assignment1/`: Directory for the first programming assignment.
      - `problem_statement.md`: The assignment's problem statement.
      - `python/`: Directory containing the Python solution.
        - `solution.py`: My solution in Python.
        - `README.md`: Explanation of the Python solution and how to run the code.
      - `cpp/`: Directory containing the C++ solution.
        - `solution.cpp`: My solution in C++.
        - `README.md`: Explanation of the C++ solution and how to compile and run the code.
  - `Week2/`: Materials for Week 2.
    - `lecture_notes.md`
    - `assignment2/`
      - `problem_statement.md`
      - `python/`

        - `README.md`
      - `cpp/`
        - `solution.cpp`
        - `README.md`
  - ...
- `Course2_Graph_Search/`: Contains materials for the second course.
  - `Week1/`
    - `lecture_notes.md`
    - `assignment1/`
      - `problem_statement.md`
      - `python/`
        - `solution.py`
        - `README.md`
      - `cpp/`
        - `solution.cpp`
        - `README.md`
  - ...
- `Course3_Greedy_Algorithms/`: Contains materials for the third course.
  - ...
- `Course4_Shortest_Paths/`: Contains materials for the fourth course.

## How to Use

Each assignment directory includes:

- `problem_statement.md`: The details of the assignment.
- `python/`: Directory containing the Python solution.
  - `solution.py`: My implementation in Python.
  - `README.md`: Instructions on how to run the Python code and explanations of the approach taken.
- `cpp/`: Directory containing the C++ solution.
  - `solution.cpp`: My implementation in C++.
  - `README.md`: Instructions on how to compile and run the C++ code and explanations of the approach taken.

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective language directory within each assignment and follow the instructions in the `README.md` files.
